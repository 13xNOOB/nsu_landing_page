# nsu_landing_page
This is the NSU website page design using tailwind.css and alpin.js



I want to use Tailwind CSS + Alpine.js to make a template for my modx project(landing page).
I do not have a lot of knowledge about either framewroks or modx so I need a lot of help to build the project. I made a HTML, CSS and JS version of the project before, but it is not very responsive. So I am switching over to Tailwind and Alpine. Can you help me make the landing page.
Steps I have done so far:
1. create project folder (D:\nsu_website_landing_page)
2. open cmd
3. npm init -y
4. npm install alpinejs
5. create style.css folder in project root directory
6. copy @import "tailwindcss"; to style.css file
7. run the following in vs code terminal npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./style.css -o ./output.css --watch



node combine.js
